# Leander (V1) Keymap

They keymap is my preference for dual encoder, dual OLED setups with a speaker on nullbits' Snap75.

It loads a Bongo Cat animation on the leader board with Typing HUD on the follower board's OLEDs.

The two OLED animations are from:
- [TypeHud](https://github.com/nullbitsco/snap/tree/main/keymaps/typehud)
- Bongo Cat
  - [Snap Source](https://github.com/nullbitsco/snap/tree/main/keymaps/bongo_reactive)
  - [Modified WPM Code](https://github.com/nwii/oledbongocat)
